The curreny repository contains: 

1) Code: Pthon minimal code growing via random sequential deposition packings of bipartite physical links for arbitrary thickness.
2) Data: A minimal data repository folder containing the 3D positions of nearly saturated packings of physical links in the case of cubic box boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions.
