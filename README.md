This repository contains: 

1) Code: Jupuyter notedbook providing the minimal code needed to grow 3D packings of bipartite physical links via random sequential deposition and extract their bundling number; 
2) Data: A minimal data repository containing the 3D positions of nearly saturated packings of bipartite and non-bipartite physical links in cubic box boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions.
