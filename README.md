The curreny repository contains: 

1) Code: Jupuyter notedbook providing the minimal code needed to grow 3D packings of bipartite physical links via random sequential deposition; 
2) Data: A minimal data repository folder containing the 3D positions of nearly saturated packings of physical links in the case of cubic box boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions.
